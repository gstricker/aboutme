## Juri

Hi I'm Juri or Yuri or Youri or Юрий, that really depends on your language. In my professional life I mostly go by the name of Georg Stricker. It is my official, though not original, name. History and cultural differences have a way of interferring with ones ID.

Above everything else I am scientist by heart with a dedication for martial arts (BJJ, boxing and thai boxing). I have a background in statistics and computer science, even all the way up to a PhD. This is not what my teenage-self has envisioned for himself, but then again he hasn't envisioned many smart things back then. Currently working with some great people on building a venture capital fund in the Crypto space and side-hustling with some modelling in sports betting.

Russian-German living between Munich and Moscow
